### Notes about UI

We can definitely make a user interface (UI) that looks professional, cozy, and uses pastel cyan blue! Since you're working with Groovy, you can use Swing or JavaFX to create the UI. Both are widely used in Java and Groovy for desktop applications, and they can give a polished, user-friendly appearance.

Steps to Tackle the UI:
Decide on the Framework:

Swing: It's simpler, and good for basic UIs. It's well-integrated with Groovy.
JavaFX: Offers more modern, flexible UI components with better styling support using CSS.
Since you want a professional and cozy feel, Iâ€™d recommend JavaFX for the ability to style the UI with CSS, including the pastel cyan blue theme.

UI Design Goals:

Professional and Cozy: We can go for smooth rounded buttons, a clean layout, and a color scheme that includes pastel cyan blue with white or light grays for contrast.
Input fields: For the directory path, search text, replacement text, and log file path, we'll need text fields, and for submitting the process, a button.
JavaFX Sample Code: Here's a simple example of how you can create a UI in JavaFX. I'll include pastel cyan blue in the design.  

Key Design Elements:
Pastel cyan blue: The button uses a pastel cyan blue (#A0D9D9), and the background is a lighter cyan (#E0F7F7), giving it a soft, cozy vibe.
Rounded corners and clean layout: You can add more styling with CSS if needed to enhance the cozy feeling with rounder edges.
Fields and Button: The UI has input fields for all necessary arguments and a button to trigger the process.
How to Run:
Save the code in a .groovy file.
Install JavaFX if needed by adding it as a dependency in your project.
Run the Groovy script, and you should see a clean, professional UI where you can input all the values.
Further Styling:
If you want to explore more, you can use CSS with JavaFX to apply custom styles. For instance, you can create a CSS file to give more styling to buttons, labels, etc.
